This package contains a tool for visualizing Alzabo database schemas
with shockwave-flash (SWF) movies.

In addition to the Alzabo and the GraphViz module - available from CPAN -
it depends on the Ming library - available at http://ming.sourceforge.net/ -
which includes the SWF Module (In 'Perl Graphics Programming' you find
a good introduction to the Ming library, which is available online at
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perlgp/chapter/ch09.pdf). 

To install the Module, execute the following commands:

perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build test
./Build install

The ./etc folder contains a configuration sample my_conf.yml and
an example script create.pl which receives the name of
an Alzabo schema and generates the corresponding SWF movie
together with an HTML Page that embeddes this movie. To view
the movie you have to get the Flash Player plugin for
your browser from http://www.macromedia.com/. 

Additionally the ./etc folder contains several FDB files, which contain
the fonts used for the default configuration and the one in my_conf.yml
